# Family-Adventure
A twine game called Family Adventure.

Journey with the kids of a family to find their parents.

Using the Twine online site to make this interactive narrative project to build an adventure story that has different endings as well as hidden endings.
The interactions through clicking brings the story to life.
Throughout the play through there will be paths that can change to another path but not being able to go back and forward between them.

The idea is to give players a fun, light adventure with a couple of funny moments. Reaching this idea by giving in to the possible ways that these kids go through their quest.
